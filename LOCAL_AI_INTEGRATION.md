## 📋 How It Works

1. **User completes health monitoring** (60-second session)
2. **Clicks "🤖 AI Analysis" button**
3. **App sends data to local Anything LLM**:
   - Heart Rate (average, min, max)
   - Blood Pressure
   - Blood Oxygen levels
   - Stress levels
   - Steps count
   - Activity type
4. **Anything LLM analyzes** the data (10-30 seconds)

## 🧪 Testing Your Integration

### **1. Test Locally**

Open in your browser:
- **Local**: https://localhost:8443/HealthMetrics.html
- **Mobile**: https://192.168.1.8:8443/HealthMetrics.html

### **2. Test Workflow**

1. ✅ Sign in with Google
2. ✅ Start health monitoring
3. ✅ Complete 60-second session
4. ✅ Click "🤖 AI Analysis"
5. ✅ Wait 10-30 seconds for AI response
6. ✅ Review personalized recommendations

### **3. Verify Anything LLM**

Check that Anything LLM is running:
```powershell
# Test API
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/ping"

# Check workspace
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/workspaces"
```

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### **Anything LLM Settings**
```javascript
{
  apiKey: 'JAV259E-E1C44YV-QVF85DM-02B47RH',
  workspace: 'hrudhi',
  baseUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:3001',
  timeout: 90000 // 90 seconds
}
```

### **Health Prompt Template**
The app sends this structured prompt:
```
You are a friendly health assistant. Analyze these vital signs:

- Heart Rate: [X] BPM (range: [Y]-[Z] BPM)
- Blood Oxygen: [X]%
- Blood Pressure: [X]/[Y] mmHg
- Stress Level: [X]%
- Steps Today: [X]
- Activity: [X]

Provide:
1. Overall health status
2. Key observations
3. Actionable recommendations
4. Lifestyle tips
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: AI Not Responding**

**Symptoms:**
- Request times out after 90 seconds
- Falls back to rule-based analysis

**Solutions:**
1. Check Anything LLM is running: http://localhost:3001
2. Verify workspace 'hrudhi' exists
3. Check API key is valid
4. Restart Anything LLM if needed
5. Check if model is still loading (can take time on first run)

### **Problem: Slow AI Responses**

**This is NORMAL for local LLMs!**
- First request: 30-60 seconds (model loading)
- Subsequent requests: 10-30 seconds
- Depends on your CPU/GPU

**To improve speed:**
- Use a smaller model in Anything LLM
- Close other applications
- Ensure Anything LLM has enough RAM
- Consider GPU acceleration if available

### **Problem: API Key Error**

**Error Message:**
```
{"error":"No valid api key found."}
```

**Solution:**
1. Open Anything LLM: http://localhost:3001
2. Go to Settings → API Keys
3. Generate new key
4. Update `apiKey` in HealthMetrics.html

| Subsequent Requests | 10-30 seconds |
| Fallback Trigger | After 90 seconds |
| Response Quality | Excellent (context-aware) |
| Privacy Level | 100% (all local) |
| Cost | $0 (free forever) |
