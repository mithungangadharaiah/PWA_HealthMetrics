# 📸 Proper Finger Placement Guide

## ❌ **WRONG - Don't Do This:**

```
    👆 (Finger pressing on lens)
    ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓
    [CAMERA LENS] ← Blocked!
    [FLASHLIGHT]
```

**Problem:** 
- Pressure distorts camera lens
- Blocks ALL light (too dark)
- Camera can't focus (too close)
- Brightness reading: 0-30 ❌

---

## ✅ **CORRECT - Do This:**

```
    👆 (Finger hovering 2-3mm above)
       ↕️ 2-3mm gap
    ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓
    [CAMERA LENS] ← Light passes through!
    [FLASHLIGHT] → 💡 ← Shines through finger
```

**Benefits:**
- Flashlight shines THROUGH your finger
- Camera sees red glow from blood vessels
- Can detect blood flow pulses
- Brightness reading: 60-220 ✅

## 🎯 **How to Find the Perfect Position:**

### **Step 1: Turn Flashlight ON**
- Tap the "🔦 Turn Flashlight ON" button
- Make sure flashlight is active (button turns yellow)

### **Step 2: Position Your Finger**
1. **Start high** - Hold finger 1cm above camera
2. **Slowly lower** your finger toward camera
3. **Look at the video feed** or **look at your finger from the side**
4. **You should see RED GLOW** through your finger
5. **STOP when you see the glow** - don't touch the lens!

## 📊 **What the Status Messages Mean:**

| Message | What It Means | What To Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **"TOO CLOSE"** | You're pressing on lens | **Lift finger up 2-3mm** |
| **"TOO FAR"** | Finger too far away | **Lower finger closer (but don't touch)** |
| **"Position fingertip over camera"** | Finger not centered | **Move finger to center camera** |
| **"Perfect! Pulse detected"** | ✅ You got it! | **Keep hovering steady!** |

---

## 🔢 **Understanding the Brightness Number:**

- **0-30:** ❌ Too close (pressing on lens) - LIFT UP!
- **30-60:** ⚠️ Too far - Lower finger closer
- **60-220:** ✅ Perfect range - Keep this!
- **220+:** ⚠️ Finger not covering - Center it over camera

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

1. **Use your INDEX finger** - easier to hold steady
2. **Rest your hand on the phone** for stability (but keep finger hovering!)
3. **Breathe normally** - holding breath affects heart rate
4. **Wait 5-10 seconds** for the app to detect your pulse
5. **Don't move or talk** during the 60-second sampling

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting:**

### Problem: "Can't detect pulse"
- ✅ Make sure flashlight is ON (button should be yellow)
- ✅ Check video feed - you should see red/pink glow
- ✅ Try different finger (index or middle finger work best)
- ✅ Make sure room isn't too bright (interferes with detection)

### Problem: "Pulse jumps around wildly"
- ✅ Hold phone completely still
- ✅ Keep finger hovering steady (don't move up/down)
- ✅ Don't press or release pressure

### Problem: "Brightness shows 0"
- ❌ You're pressing too hard on the lens
- ✅ Lift finger up 2-3mm and hover

### Problem: "Brightness shows 255"
- ❌ Finger not covering camera
- ✅ Center your fingertip directly over camera

## 🎓 **The Science:**

When the flashlight shines through your fingertip:
- Light passes through your skin tissue
- Blood in your capillaries absorbs more RED light
- Camera detects changes in red intensity
- Each heartbeat pumps blood → brightness fluctuates
- App measures these fluctuations → calculates BPM!

**This only works when light passes THROUGH your finger, which requires hovering, not pressing!**

**Remember: HOVER, don't press! 🚁**
