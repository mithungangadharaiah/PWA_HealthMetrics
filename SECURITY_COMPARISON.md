## 🚀 Ready to Build?

I can generate **production-ready code** for Firebase integration right now:

1. **auth.js** - Secure Google login
2. **analytics.js** - User tracking (privacy-compliant)
3. **admin-dashboard.html** - See your users
4. **privacy-policy.html** - Legal compliance
5. **config.js** - Environment setup

**Time estimate:** I'll generate code in 5 minutes, you'll have it running in 1-2 hours.

**Shall I proceed with Firebase implementation?** 🔥
