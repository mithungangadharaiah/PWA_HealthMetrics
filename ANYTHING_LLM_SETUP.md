# ü§ñ Anything LLM Integration - Setup Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Changed

Your Health Metrics PWA now uses **your private Anything LLM server** instead of Google Gemini!

### üìä Server Details
- **URL**: `https://20.244.104.111/api/v1/workspace/hrudhi/chat`
- **Token**: `J5AE8ED-3BXMQ01-QREQ96S-F5KN7DA`
- **Workspace**: `hrudhi`
- **Timeout**: 75 seconds (60s for LLM + 15s buffer)

---

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Extended Timeout (75 seconds)**
   - Previous: 15 seconds (Google Gemini)
   - **New**: 75 seconds (to accommodate Anything LLM's ~60s response time)
   - Prevents premature timeout errors

### 2. **Clear User Messaging**
   When AI analysis starts, users see:
   ```
   ‚è≥ Please wait up to 60 seconds for AI analysis... Do not close this window!
   ```
   - **Bold** and **visible** to prevent users from closing the window
   - Reduces confusion and abandonment

### 3. **Graceful Fallback**
   - Always shows **instant rule-based analysis** first
   - Then attempts AI enhancement
   - If AI fails ‚Üí shows "using rule-based analysis only" (not an error)
   - User always gets useful health insights!

## üîß Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working (Tested Successfully)
- Anything LLM server responds correctly
- API authentication works
- NGINX reverse proxy configured
- Response time: ~58 seconds
- Sample response: "Practice deep, slow breathing. It can help calm your nervous system."

### ‚ö†Ô∏è To Fix for Internet Access
Your server works **locally** but needs firewall configuration for **external access**:

#### On Windows Server (20.244.104.111):
```powershell
# Open port 443 in Windows Firewall
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "NGINX HTTPS" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 443 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

#### In Azure Portal:
1. Go to **Azure Portal** ‚Üí **Virtual Machines** ‚Üí Your VM
2. Click **Networking** ‚Üí **Inbound port rules**
3. **Add rule**:
   - Source: `Any`
   - Destination Port: `443`
   - Protocol: `TCP`
   - Action: `Allow`
   - Name: `Allow_HTTPS_443`

---

## üìù Testing

### Test from Your PC (After Firewall Fix):
```powershell
# PowerShell Test
$headers = @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer J5AE8ED-3BXMQ01-QREQ96S-F5KN7DA"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}
$body = '{"message":"Quick health tip for 75 BPM?","mode":"chat"}'

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://20.244.104.111/api/v1/workspace/hrudhi/chat" `
    -Method POST `
    -Headers $headers `
    -Body $body `
    -TimeoutSec 75
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "id": "79a9777e-0346-461a-874a-9d5095178e02",
  "type": "textResponse",
  "textResponse": "Practice deep, slow breathing. It can help calm your nervous system.",
  "metrics": {
    "duration": 58.217
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Push to GitHub Pages:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\mithun.gangadharaiah\Documents\GitHub\BluetoothDashboard
git push origin master
```

Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild, then test at:
**https://mithungangadharaiah.github.io/PWA_HealthMetrics/HealthMetrics.html**

## üìä Comparison: Before vs After

| Feature | Google Gemini (Before) | Anything LLM (Now) |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Provider** | Google Cloud | Your Private Server |
| **Cost** | Free (with quota limits) | Free (your server) |
| **Privacy** | Data sent to Google | Data stays on your server |
| **Timeout** | 15 seconds | 75 seconds |
| **Response Time** | ~4 seconds | ~58 seconds |
| **User Message** | Generic "Analyzing..." | "Wait 60s, don't close!" |
| **Reliability** | Depends on Google quota | Depends on your server uptime |

## üîí Security Notes

### API Token Protection:
- Token is **hardcoded in frontend** (visible in browser)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Anyone can see this token in the code
- Consider:
  - Creating workspace-specific tokens
  - Rotating tokens periodically
  - Using API rate limiting in Anything LLM

### HTTPS/SSL:
- Currently using self-signed certificate
- Browser may show "Not Secure" warnings
- For production, consider:
  - Let's Encrypt free SSL certificate
  - Valid domain name instead of IP address

## üéâ What's Next

1. **Fix Firewall** (highest priority)
   - Open port 443 on Windows Server
   - Configure Azure NSG

2. **Test from Internet**
   - Open your PWA from phone/laptop
   - Click "AI Analysis"
   - Verify 60-second wait message appears
   - Confirm AI response arrives

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check response times
   - Monitor server CPU/memory
   - Consider upgrading LLM model if too slow

4. **Optional Improvements**
   - Add progress bar for 60s wait
   - Show estimated time remaining
   - Cache common health tips
   - Add "Cancel" button for AI requests

---

## üìû Support

If AI analysis isn't working:

1. **Check server logs**:
   ```
   E:\Software\nginx-1.28.0\nginx-1.28.0\logs\error.log
   E:\Software\nginx-1.28.0\nginx-1.28.0\logs\access.log
   ```

2. **Test backend LLM**:
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/v1/workspace/hrudhi/chat
   ```

3. **Check NGINX status**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process -Name nginx
   netstat -ano | findstr :443
   ```

4. **Verify Anything LLM is running**:
   ```powershell
   tasklist | findstr node
   netstat -ano | findstr :3001
   ```
