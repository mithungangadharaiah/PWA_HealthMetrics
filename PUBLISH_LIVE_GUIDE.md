Firebase needs to know which websites can use your authentication.

### How:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/

   - Click "Authorized domains"

4. **Add your GitHub Pages URL**:
   - Click **"Add domain"**
   - Type: `mithungangadharaiah.github.io`
   - Click **"Add"**

✅ **Done!** Firebase will now allow logins from your GitHub Pages site.

## Step 2: Commit Your Code to GitHub (5 minutes)

### 2.1 Check What Changed

Open Terminal/PowerShell in VS Code and run:

```powershell
git status
```

You should see new files in red:
- firebase-auth.js
- firebase-analytics.js
- firebase-config.js
- admin-dashboard.html
- privacy-policy.html
- etc.

### 2.2 Stage All Changes

```powershell
git add .
```

This adds all new/modified files.

### 2.3 Commit with Message

```powershell
git commit -m "Add Firebase authentication and user tracking"
```

### 2.4 Push to GitHub

```powershell
git push
```

Enter your GitHub credentials if asked.

✅ **Done!** Your code is now on GitHub.

2. ⏳ **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub to build and deploy
3. Look for a **green checkmark** ✅ next to your last commit (on "Code" tab)

✅ **Done!** Your site is being deployed.

## 🔐 Important: Firebase Config Security

### ⚠️ firebase-config.js on GitHub Pages

**The Issue:**
- GitHub Pages serves static files
- `firebase-config.js` contains your API keys
- It's currently in `.gitignore` (not on GitHub)
- But you need it for your live site to work!

**The Solution (Choose One):**

### Option 1: Simple (For Small Projects - Recommended)

**Just commit firebase-config.js to GitHub:**

```powershell
# Remove from .gitignore temporarily
# Edit .gitignore and remove the line: firebase-config.js

# Then commit it
git add firebase-config.js
git commit -m "Add Firebase config for deployment"
git push
```

**Is this safe?**
- ✅ YES! Firebase API keys are **web-safe** (designed to be public)
- ✅ Your Firestore **security rules** protect your data (Step 6 from FIREBASE_SETUP.md)
- ✅ Only authenticated users can read/write data
- ✅ Domain restrictions in Firebase Console prevent abuse

**When to use:**
- Small to medium projects
- Personal apps
- MVPs and prototypes
- Up to ~10,000 users

---

### Option 2: Advanced (For Large Commercial Apps)

**Use Environment Variables with GitHub Actions:**

This is more complex and only needed for very large commercial applications. For now, **Option 1 is perfectly fine!**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Sign in doesn't work on live site"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you added `mithungangadharaiah.github.io` to Firebase Authorized Domains (Step 1)
2. Wait 5 minutes for changes to take effect
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Try again

### "404 Not Found" when opening the site
**Solution:**
1. Check GitHub Pages settings (Step 3)
2. Make sure branch is set to `master` or `main`
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
4. Check for green checkmark on commits

### "Firebase config not loaded" on live site
**Solution:**
1. Make sure `firebase-config.js` is pushed to GitHub (see Option 1 above)
2. Check that all files are committed: `git status`
3. Check browser console (F12) for specific errors

### Admin dashboard shows "Access Denied"
**Solution:**
1. Check your email in `firebase-config.js` ADMIN_EMAILS
