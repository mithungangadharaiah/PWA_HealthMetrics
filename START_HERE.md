## 💡 Pro Tips

### Security

1. **Never share** `firebase-config.js` privately (it's in `.gitignore`)
2. **But it's OK** for it to be public on GitHub Pages (Firebase designed it that way)
3. **Your Firestore rules** protect the data, not the config file
4. **Only you** can access admin dashboard (email whitelist)

### Cost Management

1. **FREE tier**: 10,000 sign-ins/month
2. **Monitor usage**: Firebase Console → Usage tab
3. **Set budgets**: Firebase Console → Billing
4. **Get alerts**: Before you're charged anything

### User Growth

1. **First 100 users**: Friends, family, social media
2. **Next 1,000 users**: Product Hunt, Reddit, forums
3. **Next 10,000 users**: Press, influencers, ads
4. **Still FREE** on Firebase! 🎉
