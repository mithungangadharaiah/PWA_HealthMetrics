# GitHub Push Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (if not already done)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `HealthMetricsPWA` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "Progressive Web App for comprehensive health monitoring"
4. Set to **Private** (recommended for commercial project)
5. Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

Once you have the repository URL, run these commands:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\mithun.gangadharaiah\OneDrive - Dynatrace\Documents\GitHub\BluetoothDashboard"

# Add remote (replace with your actual GitHub username/repo)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/HealthMetricsPWA.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
cd "C:\Users\mithun.gangadharaiah\OneDrive - Dynatrace\Documents\GitHub\BluetoothDashboard"

# Create repo and push in one command
gh repo create HealthMetricsPWA --private --source=. --push
```

- ✅ `server.crt` - SSL certificate (in .gitignore)
- ✅ `server.key` - Private key (in .gitignore)
