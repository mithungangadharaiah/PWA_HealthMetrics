   ```

### Method 2: Using GitHub Actions (Automatic)

Create this file in your repo: `.github/workflows/pages.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: '.'
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

## 📝 Important Notes for Your PWA

### ⚠️ Camera Limitations on GitHub Pages

**GitHub Pages serves over HTTPS** ✅ (Good for camera!)

**However:**
- GitHub Pages URL: `https://mithungangadharaiah.github.io/PWA_HealthMetrics/`
- Camera API works on HTTPS ✅
- Flashlight/torch API works ✅
- Should work on iPhone Safari ✅

### 🔧 Recommended: Create index.html Redirect

Since your main app is `HealthMetrics.html`, create an `index.html` to redirect:

**Create this file in your repo root:**

\`\`\`html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=./HealthMetrics.html">
    <title>Health Metrics PWA - Redirecting...</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Redirecting to Health Metrics PWA...</p>
    <p>If not redirected, <a href="./HealthMetrics.html">click here</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
\`\`\`

Then users can just visit: `https://mithungangadharaiah.github.io/PWA_HealthMetrics/`

## 🚀 After Deployment

### Test Your Deployed Site

1. **Desktop Test:**
   - Visit: https://mithungangadharaiah.github.io/PWA_HealthMetrics/HealthMetrics.html
   - Test camera functionality
   - Check if flashlight works

2. **iPhone Test:**
   - Open Safari on iPhone
   - Navigate to your GitHub Pages URL
   - Grant camera permissions
   - Test finger hover detection

3. **PWA Installation:**
   - On iPhone: Tap Share → "Add to Home Screen"
   - On Android: Browser menu → "Install app"

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

**If camera doesn't work:**
- ✅ GitHub Pages uses HTTPS (camera should work)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure camera permissions are granted

**If page shows 404:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
- Check Settings > Pages to see deployment status
- Verify branch name is correct (master vs main)

**If flashlight doesn't work:**
- Flashlight API requires secure context (HTTPS) ✅
- Some browsers don't support torch API
- iPhone Safari should work
