# 🚨 URGENT: Deploy Firestore Rules to Fix AI Permission Error

## ⚠️ Current Problem

Your admin portal shows **AI Enabled ✅** but the app shows **"No Permission"** error because:

**Firestore security rules are NOT deployed to Firebase Console!**

Firebase is using default restrictive rules that block all database access.

---

## ✅ Solution: Deploy Rules (2 minutes)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open Firebase Console**  
   👉 https://console.firebase.google.com

2. **Select Project**  
   Click on **`healthmetrics-10bdf`**

3. **Navigate to Firestore Database**  
   - Click **"Firestore Database"** in left sidebar
   - Click **"Rules"** tab at the top

4. **Delete Existing Rules**  
   - You'll see current rules in the editor
   - **Select ALL** and **DELETE**

5. **Copy New Rules**  
   Copy **ALL 60 lines** from the box below:

## 📋 FIRESTORE RULES (Copy This Entire Block)

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Helper function to check if user is admin
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == 'mithunglares@gmail.com';
    }
    
    // Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Users can read their own data
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Users can create their own document on first sign-in
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Users can update their own data (except AI permission fields)
      allow update: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.auth.uid == userId
                    && !request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
                       .hasAny(['aiEnabled', 'aiEnabledAt', 'aiModifiedAt', 'aiModifiedBy']);
      
      // Admins can do anything
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    // AI Access Requests collection
    match /aiAccessRequests/{requestId} {
      // Users can read their own requests
      allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      
      // Users can create their own requests (but only once)
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid
                    && request.resource.data.userEmail == request.auth.token.email
                    && request.resource.data.status == 'pending';
      
      // Admins can read and update all requests
      allow read, update: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    // Health Sessions collection
    match /healthSessions/{sessionId} {
      // Users can create and read their own sessions
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      
      allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      
      // Admins can read all sessions
      allow read: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    // Default deny all other collections
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### If rules don't publish:
- Check for syntax errors (red underlines)
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE rules block
- Try copying again from this file

### If permission error persists:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Sign out and sign in again
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Verify you're using mithunglares@gmail.com

### If admin dashboard still shows errors:
- Wait 30 seconds and refresh
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
